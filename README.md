# AstroPicture!

This simple application shows all the "Photos of the Day" from NASA data, sorted in descending order by date, with the ability to jump to the detailed view screen.

While waiting for an image to load, the user is shown a simple looping animation. As the list scrolls, the data loads.

Stack: SwiftUI, Combine + MVVM
